## Project decisions

- Keep the public UI presentation-only until content is approved; this protects the visual review from premature copy decisions.
- Use CSS perspective and pointer/scroll transforms for the hero dashboard rather than a WebGL scene; this preserves its crisp, accessible interface while adding depth.
